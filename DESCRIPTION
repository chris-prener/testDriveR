Description: Provides data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. 
    It includes a sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous 
    coinflip experiment. These are data that I used for statistics. The package 
    also contains an R Markdown template with the required formatting for 
    assignments in my former courses.
