Description: Provides data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. 
    It includes a sample of data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous 
    coinflip experiment. These are data that I used for teaching SOC 4015 / SOC 
    5050 at Saint Louis University (SLU). The package also contains an R Markdown
    template with the required formatting for assignments in my courses 
    SOC 4015, SOC 4650, SOC 5050, and SOC 5650 at SLU.
