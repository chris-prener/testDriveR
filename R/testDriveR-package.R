#' testDriveR: Teaching Data for Statistics and Data Science
#'
#' @description The goal of \code{testDriveR} is to provide data sets for teaching
#'     statistics and data science courses. This package includes a sample of
#'     data from John Edmund Kerrich's famous coinflip experiment. These are data
#'     that I use for teaching \href{https://slu-soc5050.github.io}{SOC 4015 / SOC 5050}
#'     at \href{Saint Louis University}{https://slu.edu}.
#'
#' @details There are currently five data sets that are included in the package:
#'
#'     \itemize{
#'       \item \code{\link{auto17}} - A data set containing model year 2017 vehicles
#'           for sale in the United States

#'           factors created and without missing data explicitly declared
