[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/testDriveR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testDriveR)

The goal of `testDriveR` is to provide data sets for teaching statistics and data science courses. These are data that I use for teaching [SOC 4930 / SOC 5050](https://slu-soc5050.github.io) at [Saint Louis University](https://slu.edu).

## Installation

`testDriveR` is not available from CRAN yet. In the meantime, you can install the development version of `testDriveR` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/testDriveR) with `devtools`:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chris-prener/testDriveR")
```

## Current Data
The package currently contains three data tables:

* `auto17` - A data set containing model year 2017 vehicles for sale in the United States
* `childMortality` - A data set containing childhood mortality time series data by country from UNICEF
* `gss16` - A data set containing a selection of variables related to work and education from the 2016 General Social Survey
* `gss16_Miss` - A copy of `gss16` without missing data explicitly identified for teaching about missing data
* `kerrich` - A data set containing 2000 trials of coin flips by John Edmund Kerrich

## Useage
Once loaded, the data contained in `testDriveR` can be loaded into data frames in your global environment and then explored. For example, to load the `auto17` data:

```r
library("testDriveR")
autoData <- auto17
str(autoData)
```
